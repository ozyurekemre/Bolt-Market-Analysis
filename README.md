🎯 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end market entry and financial feasibility case study prepared for a Bolt Mobility interview.

The goal was to evaluate whether Bolt should expand its e-scooter fleet into Barcelona by analyzing:

Market potential

Demand sizing (top-down & bottom-up)

Tourist-driven elasticity

Competitor landscape

Regulatory constraints

Unit economics

Pricing strategy

Financial viability

Risk mitigation

12-month roadmap for profitable launch

All insights were created using publicly available data, industry benchmarks, and self-designed models.

1. 📊 Market Sizing
Top-Down Model

Based on Barcelona mobility & micro-mobility penetration metrics:

Potential annual rides (locals only):
📌 2.45M rides
Source: Slide “Top-Down Analysis”

Bottom-Up Model

Using:

Population in high-traffic districts

User conversion estimates

Operating hours

Daily ride cadence

Estimated annual rides:
📌 2.02M rides
Source: Slide “Bottom-Up Analysis”

Tourism Adjustment

Barcelona has >12M annual tourists.
Weighted tourist mobility multiplier introduces:

📌 +1.8M rides

FINAL TOTAL MARKET SIZE
🔥 3.82M annual rides

(locals + tourists)

2. 💶 Financial Viability (Year 1)

Built using a custom revenue/cost model:

Result:

📌 €6.85M EBITDA
📌 57.8% EBITDA Margin

→ Highly viable market for Bolt’s scooter vertical

3. 📈 Unit Economics

Based on industry benchmarks + modeled cost stack:

Breakeven point: ~2.1 rides/day/scooter

Battery swap cost: modeled per 100 rides

Maintenance: modeled by part failure frequency

Expected scooter lifespan: 2–3 years

Fleet utilization assumption: 65–75%

Key insight:
Barcelona meets and exceeds required breakeven utilization due to tourist seasonality.

4. 🧭 Competitive Landscape

Major players in Barcelona:

Lime

Tier

Dott

Local operators

Benchmarked by:

Price/min

Unlock fee

Zone coverage

App UX

Promotions

Fleet size

5. ⚖️ Regulations

Barcelona has strict micro-mobility rules:

Fleet cap: 3,975 scooters (municipality-wide)

Parking: only official docking zones

Speed limit: 25 km/h

Insurance: mandatory

Fines: up to €100 for improper parking

This heavily affects fleet planning & operating model.
